**Strapi** is a `React` application that features a fully functional and responsive navbar with submenus, ensuring an intuitive user experience for both large and small screens. Built using `Vite`, `React.js`, `React Icons`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and the `Nanoid` Library, this application closely emulates the smooth navigation and transitions of the actual **Strapi** site.

The fully responsive design, functional navbar with submenus, smooth transitions, and accurate icon representations provide an authentic and seamless user experience.
